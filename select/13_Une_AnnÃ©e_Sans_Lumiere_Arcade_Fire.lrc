[00:13.31] Hey!
[00:15.53] The streetlights all burnt out
[00:19.87] Une année sans lumière
[00:24.45] Je monte un cheval
[00:29.02] Qui porte des œillères
[00:40.02] 
[00:40.72] Hey, my eyes are shooting sparks
[00:47.38] La nuit, mes yeux t'éclairent
[00:51.89] N'dis pas à ton père
[00:56.50] Qu'il porte des œillères
[01:08.50] 
[01:07.93] Hey, your old man should know
[01:14.47] If you see a shadow
[01:19.16] There's something there
[01:30.66] 
[01:27.69] So hey! my eyes are shooting sparks
[01:35.02] La nuit mes yeux t'éclairent
[01:39.58] Ne dis pas à ton père
[01:44.08] Qu'il porte des oeillères
[01:56.58] 
[01:55.26] Hey, your old man should know
[02:02.03] If you see a shadow
[02:06.43] There's something there
[02:17.93] 
[03:04.15] Hey, give it to her
[03:07.97] She's in, give to her!
[03:10.65] She's in love, come on give it to her!
[03:15.59] Give it to her, come on give it to her!
[03:20.29] Give it to her, come on give it to her!
[03:23.44] Her, her, her!
